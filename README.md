# PHP-Script-to-Read-from-SQL-DB

A simple PHP script to read a table form SQL DB<br>

Fill in the correct credentials of your SQL DB in the index.php<br><br>

Make sure to modify the script accordingly to read the required row from the table you want to read. (I have tried to read a table called "users" and fetch two rows from it.
